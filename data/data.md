# Data summary
    
    - overlap.fa contains sequences from merged_clip peaks experiments that do overlap with eCLIP peaks.
    - overlap.bed is the corresponding bed file to overlap.fa containing just coordinates and information about the number of peaks
    - combined_sorted_idr.bed contains high quality eCLIP peaks (short sequences) that will be used for sampling strategies.
    - hg38.fa is the human reference genome.
